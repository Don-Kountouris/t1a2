INTRODUCTION

The ‘T1A2 Portfolio Assignment’ was an excellent introduction into web development. If you had spoken to me at the beginning of this assignment my attitude would have been vastly different. I felt completely out of my depth and over my head in what I was in for. Now, at the tail end of the assignment, I have enjoyed the experience of learning how to use HTML and CSS together to create something both personal and purposeful. It has sparked a greater sense of enthusiasm in my learning to come.

This assignment will express the ideas, problems and learning I have experienced while showing a student’s attempt at not only becoming a skill full student, but someone who will be a well-rounded professional.


PURPOSE

Portfolios have different purposes. The type of portfolio you choose will depend on the targeted audience and, in this case, learning objectives. For a professional, a portfolio is simply used to show one’s best work. The portfolio presented in this assignment is a student’s work covering the progress, process and reflective capabilities developed at this point in the course. 

This portfolio is intended to demonstrate the development of knowledge and skills representing a range of experiences or instances organised to show improvement in performance.

Throughout this process, there were various stages of development and a number of ideas revisited and amended. The reasons for such changes are important to the process, its purpose and final deployment of the portfolio. These changes have been noted and included as part of the assignment. These responses allow a student to make connections between course material and service-learning experiences.


TARGET AUDIENCE

A Web Developer portfolio is an important addition to any marketing plan and can help forge new paths in a career. As a student this website is an assignment aimed at not only showcasing what I can currently achieve, but in addition how persistent, resourceful and hardworking I am. Although this is my first website creation, I am pleased with what I have created. I believe in time I will want to amend much of this site and perhaps erase it and start from scratch. There are problems, ideas and elements in this creation that I am both limited and frustrated with, but I understand things will change over time. Basically, my target audience is you.


FUNCTINALITY / FEATURES

As a student, it can be intimidating either referencing or resourcing the plethora of professional portfolios and detailed tutorials online. However, with some persistence and through a fog of trial and error, the basic language of computer science made sense and accomplishment.

My portfolio is built upon both HTML and CSS with a small amount of JavaScript. Although it is a fairly simple code to build and run, as stated previously, there was much trial and error in its development. 

As this portfolio spans over various pages and sections, it is important to retain a consistent visual design/theme while both clearly and subtly separating its components. The language of HTML made this fairly straight forward as it is a simple, readable and comprehendible code. As an example, it is extremely important that the site translates to various devices and screen sizes. Within the initial html setup in the index.html file the code to control this is:

<img width="1178" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-19 at 5 39 15 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99586803/159111500-cd38ae4a-584b-4460-ada4-ed3516cc1b17.png">

The “viewport” suggests what we will see (view) when landing on the site and that the “content” on the screen is equal to the “device-width” at an initial set scale of 1. As the code suggests it can be easily understood once both read and run that what we will see will be scaled accordingly dependant on the size of the screen.

In addition, a common theme throughout every html file is the header section. This not only retains consistency but also allows for the user to easily return to the home page or navigate their way to a different page or section. As there are various contents available it is important to allow the user an efficient way of navigating themselves to related information. I did this by placing a ‘hamburger’ styled menu at the top right of the landing page and each further page that branches out. 

<img width="1402" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-19 at 5 39 06 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99586803/159111580-b314ec7e-6830-4a11-ac28-3e41fb373f2a.png">

The chosen colour design aim deliberately at both simplicity and emphasis. Dark and light contrasting text and background themes juxtaposed with simplicity stand out. However, tempting it may be to follow suit of other examples and implement a complex but beautiful page design, given the purpose of the assignment, the simplest solution may be the best. Lastly, the addition of a highlight colour (#16e0bd) ‘medium aquamarine’ breaks black and white monotony. 

The various sections of the landing page (index.html) are separated by the inverse of these colours. The section following on from the ‘introduction’ is a stark visual change that allows for a clear separation of information. 

<img width="650" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-19 at 5 46 16 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99586803/159111676-cb4f6acb-c0fe-42d3-8805-7a0ce0726b92.png">

Here, I reference the skills sections of many professional web developers and the descriptions they describe. For me, a focus in this assignment was to reveal more of myself rather than a projection of myself, thus I attempted to personalise the skills and what they mean to me or possibly mean to the user. The hamburger menu remains in the in the ‘introduction’ section and a ‘my work’ button is available now in the ‘services’ section allowing the user to reference the relevant examples of my previous work.

<img width="838" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-19 at 5 47 57 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99586803/159111737-6cbc877d-f310-4d8d-bf9d-5dc9e8e4c8a6.png">

Following on from this section is the ‘Who I am’ section where the user can read a short history of who I am. Similar themes have remained consistent and as stated previously, an inverse of the colour theme has distinguished a new section. In addition, the layout has mirrored the ‘introduction’ section in order to avoid repeating sections while retaining a consistent theme. 

<img width="800" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-19 at 5 50 01 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99586803/159111939-5c882572-5e66-496e-8be3-cb1563162955.png">

A ‘resume’ button is available linking a detailed curriculum vitae in pdf format as an extension of the ‘about me’ section. Both the ‘my work’ and ‘about me’ buttons expand and collapse when hovered over or are selected. Simple actions such as this are included in every area or element where either a link or shortcut is available.

<img width="900" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-19 at 5 58 10 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99586803/159112004-f117a991-d7c2-4d2c-b375-83bb5cb32871.png">

The last section of the index.html is the ‘my work’ section. This allows a web developer the opportunity to showcase some of their previous work and examples. As a web developer candidate this portfolio is the first - of many - web sites I will develop as a graduate and professional. Many of the examples included here are not web sites I have created by code, rather they are an accumulation of ‘paid for’ website services designed to suit a business, one being one of my own. 

<img width="650" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-19 at 5 59 48 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99586803/159112057-f022e976-9572-4ac8-9455-243c54873b02.png">

Similar to the coded actions of the buttons, the examples here expand and contract when selected. In addition, a fade action has been included in that as the image expands it becomes transparent in relation to the background colour, vice versa when deselected. These image examples link to their corresponding live websites. This addition was not a prerequisite of the assignment, however referencing many professional web developer portfolios it is an essential part of a portfolio. As my skills develop and as I create and deploy future websites, I will add these as part of my portfolio.

At the bottom of this section are, as required, links to professional web accounts: Codepen, Linkedin and Github. The icons were sourced from Font Awesome located within the ‘footer’ section of the html.index.

<img width="700" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-19 at 6 02 01 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99586803/159112117-76f62847-9c78-4f0a-bd13-0e9308ea16c9.png">

We can see the complete html code that defines the footer section. This is another clear example of simplistic and readable code that can be easily broken down and understood:

<img width="637" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-19 at 6 04 25 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99586803/159112223-a8670b51-0d3a-4ba5-9d1b-b6379a5a92e0.png">

Note: BEM (Block Element Modifier) is used throughout the html and css code. This allows one to keep track of what components rely on another. Thus, if any modifications are made, one could see what is ‘block’ (or what could be thought of as a ‘parent’) and what is a ‘child’. For example, social-list is a ‘block’, while social-list__item exists within the social-list.

Returning to the top of the portfolio, we now enter the menu where a list of index short cuts and external pages are available. Note that the hamburger style menu icon has transformed into an ‘X’, indicating how to return to the landing page.

<img width="550" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-19 at 6 06 51 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99586803/159112264-609955c4-fb97-4abf-9316-f32687916184.png">

There are two new editions that have yet to be explored in this list. ‘Home’, ‘My Services’, ‘About Me’ and ‘My Work’ are all short cuts to sections of the html.index. Whereas, ‘Blogs’ and ‘Contact’ are links to separate html pages. 

As a prerequisite of the assignment, a separate blogs page was added in order to create a section where a list of mock blogs could be sourced. Here, the page follows the same theme and layout as previous pages show with the addition of list of articles. 

<img width="348" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-19 at 6 08 43 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99586803/159112321-a530b49e-2e3d-474f-9f42-555e5a4e1c13.png">

This list is not the same ‘list’ as shown in the footer code and description, instead it is an ‘article’ list using the appropriate <article> tag. Separating the list of blogs within the article section allowed for the design sequential stack of articles including heading, authorship and date, blurb and image link to the referred article. If required, there could be an infinite number of blogs listed on this page and as shown the user can scroll though the various articles available.
  
<img width="700" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-19 at 6 10 08 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99586803/159112358-fb488b0c-2b3a-440a-9a33-a0a8c06d2ab8.png">

The last html page connected to the index.html is the ‘Contact’ page. Although it follows the familiar style and themes of its counterpart pages, the contact page has the least amount of text/information. Therefore, it is a very simple page with no more than the necessary details required.

<img width="550" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-19 at 6 11 54 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99586803/159112438-ae349c6c-7ef1-47d5-862b-bc93bee17313.png">

Each page that branches out from the index.html can easily return to the home/landing page via the hamburger menu. Efficient and accessible navigation throughout a website, particularly a portfolio, is a key ingredient and to its success and this was a primary focus for the assignment.


SITEMAP

Sitemaps are clear and structured layouts that provide planning for developers regarding information on a proposed website. Below are two versions; i) showing the index.html branches and what information they are intended to show and lead to, ii) shows the various pathways a user can navigate through on the website.

<img width="700" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-19 at 6 14 38 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99586803/159112524-154fab23-280c-4203-bca3-78e1ade3471a.png">

<img width="650" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-19 at 6 15 46 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99586803/159112566-4938ca8d-2ae8-4baa-86bc-846ffc9eb159.png">

CHALLENGES

As stated in the introduction, initially the process was slow and frustrating. Many of the simplest coding sequences and tasks were unfamiliar and difficult to contextualise. As the assignment drew nearer to its close, pennies began to drop and both html and CSS became more familiar and readable.

The hamburger style menu is a fantastic addition to this website, however there is one flaw in that I have yet to discover how to keep the menu visible while scrolling down the main page. The menu remains in the top right corner of the landing page and as you scroll down the option to explore the website is limited. I would much prefer that the hamburger menu float on top of the website so it is always there as an option.

In the ‘Who I am’ section, the resume button is not situated centre of the page, instead it is centre of the paragraph. There is a similar issue with the main image within all the blog pages. There have been numerous attempts to resolve this all of which are not successful for both large or small screen.

The images referring to previous work do have an effect that works and is satisfactory, however with more skill I would like to make this far more impressive. With a high standard of web development that exists on the net, a better option could be explored in the hands of someone far more proficient than myself.

The paragraph text below the headings is not relative to the page’s layout. Depending on what size screen you are viewing the website on, the text may line up or not. I have attempted to resolve this issue with no success. 

The main blog image at the bottom of the article text of the blog1-5.html does not correlate in position between a desktop screen and phone screen. I have been unable to resolve this issue. As stated previously, this is an ongoing issue I have had where designing and creating a website on a desktop screen does not always correlate to a small screen, despite preparing for differences to exist.
TECH STACK

Code:
-	HTML, CSS and JavaScript

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) was an integral and dominate part of this assignment. As stated previously, the language is an easily readable and comprehendible code to use particularly at this stage in the course. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) were then used to style the sites mark up or structure. Here a style.css can be found linked to the html pages.

Although not a prerequisite, it was allowed to use some JavaScript to add to the navigation/menu.

Visual Studio Code:
-	Visual Studio Code was used to code this assignment. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation and debugging.

Netlify:
-	Netlify supports static website generators. It is a fast and simple way to host the portfolio and deploy.

Wireframe Editor:
-	Figma

The most difficult aspect of this assignment was implementing through code the vision that was initially created in the wireframe. Despite the discrepancies between creation and result are relatively minimal, much of the time consumed in the assignment was in problem solving through trial and error. In particular, constructing the website for mobile first, coding and creating the website on a laptop, deploying the site only to see the many problems that exist not only on the laptop screen, but more so on the iPhone.

Many of these problems have been detailed throughout the html, CSS and JavaScript files, but it’s important to note here that it was by no means ‘smooth sailing’ and much time was spent understanding how to manipulate some of the simplest tasks.
