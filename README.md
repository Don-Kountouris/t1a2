INTRODUCTION

The ‘T1A2 Portfolio Assignment’ was an excellent introduction into web development. If you had spoken to me at the beginning of this assignment my attitude would have been vastly different. I felt completely out of my depth and over my head in what I was in for. Now, at the tail end of the assignment, I have enjoyed the experience of learning how to use HTML and CSS together to create something both personal and purposeful. It has sparked a greater sense of enthusiasm in my learning to come.

This assignment will express the ideas, problems and learning I have experienced while showing a student’s attempt at not only becoming a skill full student, but someone who will be a well-rounded professional.


PURPOSE

Portfolios have different purposes. The type of portfolio you choose will depend on the targeted audience and, in this case, learning objectives. For a professional, a portfolio is simply used to show one’s best work. The portfolio presented in this assignment is a student’s work covering the progress, process and reflective capabilities developed at this point in the course. 

This portfolio is intended to demonstrate the development of knowledge and skills representing a range of experiences or instances organised to show improvement in performance.

Throughout this process, there were various stages of development and a number of ideas revisited and amended. The reasons for such changes are important to the process, its purpose and final deployment of the portfolio. These changes have been noted and included as part of the assignment. These responses allow a student to make connections between course material and service-learning experiences.


TARGET AUDIENCE

A Web Developer portfolio is an important addition to any marketing plan and can help forge new paths in a career. As a student this website is an assignment aimed at not only showcasing what I can currently achieve, but in addition how persistent, resourceful and hardworking I am. Although this is my first website creation, I am pleased with what I have created. I believe in time I will want to amend much of this site and perhaps erase it and start from scratch. There are problems, ideas and elements in this creation that I am both limited and frustrated with, but I understand things will change over time. Basically, my target audience is you.


FUNCTIONALITY / FEATURES

As a student, it can be intimidating either referencing or resourcing the plethora of professional portfolios and detailed tutorials online. However, with some persistence and through a fog of trial and error, the basic language of computer science made sense and accomplishment.

My portfolio is built upon both HTML and CSS with a small amount of JavaScript. Although it is a fairly simple code to build and run, as stated previously, there was much trial and error in its development. 

As this portfolio spans over various pages and sections, it is important to retain a consistent visual design/theme while both clearly and subtly separating its components. The language of HTML made this fairly straight forward as it is a simple, readable and comprehendible code. As an example, it is extremely important that the site translates to various devices and screen sizes. Within the initial html setup in the index.html file the code to control this is:

<img width="900" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99586803/159108830-1428cde8-b876-416a-ae61-8291b31b87b6.png">

The image on the left shows the ‘hamburger’ menu in the top right corner of the landing page. The image on the right shows the sites menu/navigation section. Note that the hamburger has changed to an ‘x’ indicating to leave the navigation section and return ‘home’.

The chosen colour design aim deliberately at both simplicity and emphasis. Dark and light contrasting text and background themes juxtaposed with simplicity stand out. However, tempting it may be to follow suit of other examples and implement a complex but beautiful page design, given the purpose of the assignment, the simplest solution may be the best. Lastly, the addition of a highlight colour (#16e0bd) ‘medium aquamarine’ breaks black and white monotony. 

The various sections of the landing page (index.html) are separated by the inverse of these colours. The section following on from the ‘introduction’ is a stark visual change that allows for a clear separation of information.
